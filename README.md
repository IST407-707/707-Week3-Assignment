# Week 3 Assignment - Case Study

This week is your first case study.  You can apply any techniques you are familiar with, but you should aim to perform through and well-motivated evaluations of whatever approaches you apply.  Please refer to the online rubric.  This assignment is due by Sunday, 9.16, by 11:59PM.

Use [this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) of transnational sales for a UK-based retail company. Your goal is to provide marketing guidance to stakeholders.  To make this clear, imagine that the company has a budget of $50 million dollar to allocate. What sorts of customers should they focus on?  Which products should be promoted?

Here are some orienting questions, but these are only to get you started.  You do not need to answer all of them. 
   - Are there natural groups of customers?
   - How much do they spend?
   - Can you predict where they come from?
   - Are there natural groups of products?
   - Who buys them?  Which are the most lucrative?
